# GitHub Setup for Cloud Deployment

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository named: `fin-agent-with-claude` (or your preferred name)
3. Make it **Private** (recommended - contains trading strategies)
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have code)

## Step 2: Add Remote

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fin-agent-with-claude.git

# Verify
git remote -v
```

## Step 3: Push Initial Code

```bash
# Add all files (if not already staged)
git add .

# Commit if needed
git commit -m "Add cloud automation infrastructure"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Deploy to Cloud

Once pushed to GitHub, just run:
```bash
/deploy-cloud
```

This will automatically pull the latest changes on the remote server!

## Alternative: Use Existing Repo

If you want to use an existing repo:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```
