# Put-Selling Scanner Execution

I'll execute a comprehensive put-selling scanner workflow and generate a professional report.

## Step 1: Market Overview Analysis
Let me start by getting the current market volatility environment and VIX data.

I'll use the **volatility-analyzer** agent to assess current market conditions:
- VIX level and percentile
- Overall market volatility environment
- Sector performance context
- IV rank analysis across major stocks

## Step 2: Technical Screening
Next, I'll use the **technical-stock-analyzer** agent to screen for ideal put-selling setups:
- Stocks in uptrends with pullbacks to support
- Range-bound stocks near support levels
- RSI levels indicating oversold but not broken
- Strong support level identification
- Volume and momentum analysis

Default watchlist: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, TSLA, NVDA, META, JPM, BAC, UNH
Custom watchlist: $1 (if provided)

## Step 3: Options Analysis
Using the **options-scanner** agent to:
- Analyze options chains for qualified stocks
- Find optimal 30-45 delta put strikes
- Calculate expected premiums and returns
- Assess implied volatility levels
- Check bid-ask spreads and liquidity

## Step 4: Generate Professional Report
Create comprehensive markdown report with:
- Executive summary
- Market conditions assessment
- Top 5-10 put-selling opportunities
- Risk/reward analysis for each
- Position sizing recommendations
- Entry timing guidance

## Step 5: Email Delivery
Email address: $2 (if provided)
Draft only: $3 (if "draft" specified)

If email provided:
- Format as professional HTML
- Include risk disclaimers
- Send via Gmail or create draft
- Confirm delivery status
